# yarp-ros-service-example

This repository aims to test the generation of yarpidl_rosmsg files for the use-case where the .srv and .msg files are in the ros workspace

To test this repository, the requirements are as follows:


*  YARP
*  ycm
*  sudo apt install ros-DISTRO-ros-base
*  sudo apt install ros-DISTRO-roscpp-tutorials
*  sudo apt install ros-DISTRO-rospy-tutorials
*  sudo apt install ros-tf2-msgs

The branch main works along with the pull request, and the branch generatation-issue replicates the errors with the yarp commit
